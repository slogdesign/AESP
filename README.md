Alternative Emergency Support Platform (AESP)
Purpose
The Alternative Emergency Support Platform (AESP) was created with a clear mission in mind: to provide individuals with alternative options for emergency support services beyond traditional law enforcement agencies. The primary goal is to offer a resource for those who may require assistance in various non-violent and non-criminal situations, such as mental health crises, domestic violence incidents, support for LGBTQ+ individuals, and elderly services.

Why AESP?
AESP was born out of a desire to make our communities safer, more inclusive, and compassionate. It acknowledges that not all emergencies require a police response and that some situations can be better addressed by specialized support organizations. By providing easy access to these organizations, AESP aims to reduce unnecessary encounters with law enforcement and promote more effective and empathetic responses to diverse emergencies.

Key Features
Geolocation: AESP uses geolocation to identify a user's location, allowing for the quick identification of nearby support services.
Categorized Services: The app categorizes support services into various areas, including mental health, domestic violence, LGBTQ+ support, and elderly services.
Direct Dialing: Users can easily call these services directly from the app to request assistance.
Get Involved
AESP is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from developers, designers, and anyone interested in furthering its mission. Whether it's improving the user interface, adding new support organizations, or enhancing the geolocation features, your contributions can help make our communities safer and more inclusive.
